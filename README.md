## Project Overview

AI Posture Assistant uses pose estimation to detect body landmarks and calculate neck angle.  
Based on the calculated angle, it determines whether the person is:

- ✅ Maintaining Good Posture  
- ❌ Slouching  

It then provides corrective suggestions to improve posture.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- MediaPipe  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Requests  

---

## How It Works

1. The system loads an image.
2. MediaPipe detects body landmarks.
3. Neck angle is calculated using shoulder, ear, and hip points.
4. If angle < 150° → Slouching detected.
5. Otherwise → Good posture detected.
